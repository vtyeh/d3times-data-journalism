					<p>Using the 2014 one-year estimates from the<a href="https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml">
					U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey</a> and survey data from the 
					<a href="https://chronicdata.cdc.gov/Behavioral-Risk-Factors/BRFSS-2014-Overall/5ra3-ixqq">
					Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System</a>, we can explore the relationship between 
					fertility of women above and below the poverty line and how exercise might come in to play.</p>
					<p>As the percent of women who had a child within the past 12 months and were below the poverty level 
					($15,000-$40,000 in 2014 depending on family size) went up, the percent of those who exercised within the past month
					went down. The correlation coefficient between these two variables is -0.76. This means that there is a strong correlation
					between these two events.</p>
					<p>As the percent in fertility went up in women who were 200% above the poverty level, the percent of those who exercised 
					went up as well. The correlation coefficient between these two variables is 0.68, which is also an indication of strong correlation.</p>
					<p>Perhaps this is the case because women below the poverty line need to work multiple jobs to provide for her newborn child/children and 
						do not have the time to perform physical activity other than hard labor. Also, they might not have the money to afford a 
						gym membership or gym equipment. Whereas, on the other hand, women who are above the poverty line do have the time and money
						for simple luxuries such as exercising. However, correlation does not imply causation. These are just some plausible reasons
						for the strong correlation between the two. Also, the data on exercise includes the male population as well.
