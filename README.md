* Downloaded and explored data from the 2014 one-year estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey and from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System.
* Cleaned up the csv (comma separated values) files using Microsoft Excel and tested for correlation between factors using the function =CORREL().
* Generated a dynamic visualization using d3.js to tell the story between health risks and particular demographics.
* Embedded the d3 HTML file into the main HTML using iframe.
